				<h2>Colorguard</h2>
				<p> I first learned how to spin a flag when I joined my high school's colorguard team at the start of freshman year. 
					By senior year, I was the co-captain of not only this team, but also of another student-run band & guard organization.

				<h2>Singing</h2>
				<p> For as long as I can remember, I've always loved to sing. In high school, I made it into my high school senior acapella group, 
					and we sang the national anthem at a Golden State Warrior's game! For now, I've retired back to singing in the shower.

				<h2>Dancing</h2>
				<p> I first tried dancing in high school. It was terrifying and not easy in the beginning, yet I somehow wanted more. 
					In college, I have had more opportunities to learn and grow, trying my best to attend workshops in between classes and other responsibilities. 
					During my senior year, I became the dance coordinator for Alpha Phi Omega's dance team at UCI.

				<h2>Food and Friends</h2>
